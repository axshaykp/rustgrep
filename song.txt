(Verse 1)
In the land of code, where languages unfold,
There's a tale of power, in a story to be told.
Rust emerges, with strength untold,
A language so robust, a story to be bold.

(Chorus)
Oh, Rust, you're the guardian of memory,
With safety and speed, you set the programmers free.
In the syntax of steel, and the heart of the machine,
Rust, oh Rust, your elegance is keen.

(Verse 2)
Through lifetimes of bugs and memory woes,
Rust arrives, breaking all the foes.
No more segfaults, no more despair,
In the world of Rust, we breathe fresh air.

(Chorus)
Oh, Rust, you're the guardian of memory,
With safety and speed, you set the programmers free.
In the syntax of steel, and the heart of the machine,
Rust, oh Rust, your elegance is keen.

(Bridge)
Borrow checker whispers, like a vigilant guide,
Ensuring lifetimes are managed with pride.
Ownership, lifetimes, and borrowing dance,
In the realm of Rust, where errors have no chance.

(Verse 3)
Threads and concurrency, a symphony so grand,
Fearlessly taming parallel lands.
No more races, no more strife,
Rust, you carve the path to a stable life.

(Chorus)
Oh, Rust, you're the guardian of memory,
With safety and speed, you set the programmers free.
In the syntax of steel, and the heart of the machine,
Rust, oh Rust, your elegance is keen.

(Outro)
So here's to Rust, with gratitude we sing,
A language of power, to which we cling.
In the world of bits, where systems align,
Rust, oh Rust, forever you'll shine.
